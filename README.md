# My process

I initially had something with eyes in the background that opened and closed. After a feedback session with Daan i was given the adve to start from scratch and experiment a lot more with css selectors.

## Initial concept

I had the idea to make a psychadelic website design inspired by Indian culture. After a while nothing was really working and i was struggling with finding examples of psychadelic css stylings.

After a while i set up a code pen project and started experimenting within that, in the end i managed to make some cool psychadelic visuals.
